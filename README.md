# phantomsarch

low effort arch spinoff exclusively for convenience

since distrobox is a thing i have no reason to maintain the ISOs, i can use fedora with arch's 3rd party packages,so only the repo will be maintained.

# Repo

add this to your pacman.conf
```
[phn-repo]
SigLevel = Never
Server = https://github.com/phantomic12/phantomsarch/releases/download/repo/
```

# Where to download
SourceForge link attached, whole isos obtainable from there but download speeds are rather slow
(COMING SOON)
will provide split zip files on GitHub Releases, click on the releases tag, and click on the release with the most recent date


this project is dead, was (mostly) pointless since chaptic aur exists, might make a small repo of packages that arent there, anyone is more than welcome to use this code for their own purposes, no need to credit me.
