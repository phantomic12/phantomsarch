## How do i get the client id and the other stuff?
1. Go to [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
2. Make a New Application and name it whatever you want. (this is also the name of your RPC)

![DevPortal](https://github.com/Rayrsn/Discord-Custom-RPC/raw/main/images/newapp.png?raw=true)

3. Then head to the Rich Presence tab.

![RichPresence](https://github.com/Rayrsn/Discord-Custom-RPC/raw/main/images/richpresence.png?raw=true)

4. Scroll down to the "Rich Presence Assets" section

5. Here you can upload any image you want. (it has to be 512x512, there are many online tools that resize images for you)
Also remember you can't rename the image once you hit the "Save Changes" button. (it has to be deleted and reuploaded)

6. Then head back to the "General Information" tab and copy the Application ID. (this is the same as Client ID)
